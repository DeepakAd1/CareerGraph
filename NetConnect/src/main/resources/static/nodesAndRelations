## Optimized Graph Schema for NetConnect

Based on our discussion about refining the knowledge graph for your Personalized Professional Networking Platform (NetConnect), here's the detailed schema with nodes, their properties, relationships, and relationship properties. This design optimizes for recommendations, search, and scalability in Neo4j, building on your initial ideas. Nodes use unique labels, and relationships are directed where possible for efficient queries. Properties are suggested as strings, numbers, dates, or lists unless specified.

### Nodes and Properties
- **Person** (Represents users/professionals):
  - id: string (unique identifier, e.g., UUID)
  - name: string
  - dateOfBirth: date (date of birth)
  - location: string (e.g., "New York, USA")
  - current_position: string (e.g., "Software Engineer")
  - years_of_experience: number (e.g., 5)
  - education: list of strings (e.g., ["B.S. Computer Science", "M.S. Data Science"])
  - interests: list of strings (e.g., ["AI", "Web Development"])

- **Skill** (Represents professional skills):
  - id: string (unique identifier)
  - name: string (e.g., "Java")
  - certification: string or boolean (e.g., "Oracle Certified Java Programmer" or true/false)
  - proficiency_level: string (e.g., "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced")
  - years_of_experience: number (e.g., 3)

- **Company** (Represents organizations):
  - id: string (unique identifier)
  - name: string (e.g., "Google")
  - location: string (e.g., "Mountain View, CA")
  - employee_count: number (e.g., 150000)
  - industry_type: string (e.g., "Technology" or "Finance")
  - description: string (brief company overview)

- **Job** (Represents job postings):
  - id: string (unique identifier)
  - title: string (e.g., "Senior Developer")
  - description: string (job details)
  - required_qualifications: list of strings (e.g., ["Bachelor's degree", "5+ years experience"])
  - work_type: string (e.g., "remote", "hybrid", "onsite")
  - salary_range: string (e.g., "$120k - $150k")
  - posted_date: date (e.g., 2025-07-28)

### Relationships and Properties
These are directed for query efficiency but can be traversed bidirectionally in Cypher. Properties add context like weights or dates.

- **Person -[:KNOWS]- Person** (For professional connections):
  - strength: string (e.g., "strong", "weak" based on shared attributes)
  - since: date (when the connection was established)

- **Person -[:HAS_SKILL]- Skill** (Links users to their skills):
  - proficiency: number (e.g., 1-10 scale for expertise level)

- **Person -[:WORKS_AT]- Company** (Employment history):
  - start_date: date
  - end_date: date (null if current)
  - role: string (e.g., "Engineer")

- **Company -[:POSTS]- Job** (Jobs posted by companies):
  - posted_date: date (redundant with job property for quick filtering)

- **Skill -[:REQUIRED_FOR]- Job** (Skills needed for jobs; bidirectional for matching):
  - match_score: number (e.g., 0-100 relevance score, calculated or manual)

### Additional Notes
- **Optional Node**: If locations are complex, add a **Location** node (id, city, country) with **Job -[:LOCATED_IN]- Location** (no properties needed).
- **Optional Relationship**: **Person -[:INTERESTED_IN]- Skill/Job** (for user preferences; properties: interest_level: number).
- **Implementation Tip**: In Spring Data Neo4j, define these with annotations (e.g., @Node, @Relationship). For example, a Cypher query for job recommendations could be: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL {proficiency: >7}]->(s:Skill)-[:REQUIRED_FOR {match_score: >80}]->(j:Job) RETURN j.title, s.name`.

This schema is refined for your project's needs—flexible yet efficient. If you want to adjust for specific features or see code examples, let me know!



Great! Now that your `addPerson` API is complete and working, the next logical APIs to implement for your **Knowledge Graph (KG)** system would depend on what entities and relationships you want to work with next.

Here’s a recommended **step-by-step roadmap**:

---

### ✅ 1. **Create Skill API (if not done)**

* **POST /addSkill** — to add a new skill node.

```json
{
  "name": "Java"
}
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Create Relationship API: Person HAS\_SKILL Skill**

* **POST /person/{personId}/skill/{skillId}**

  * This will create a `HAS_SKILL` relationship between a person and a skill.

---

### ✅ 3. **Get Person by ID**

* **GET /person/{id}**

  * To fetch full details of a person including relationships like `HAS_SKILL`, `WORKS_AT`, etc.

---

### ✅ 4. **Get All Persons / Filtered Search**

* **GET /persons**

  * Optional: Add filtering like `?skill=Java&location=Delhi`.

---

### ✅ 5. **Add Company API**

* **POST /addCompany**

```json
{
  "name": "TCS",
  "location": "Mumbai"
}
```

---

### ✅ 6. **Create Relationship: Person WORKS\_AT Company**

* **POST /person/{personId}/company/{companyId}**

---

### ✅ 7. **Add Job API**

* **POST /addJob**

```json
{
  "title": "Software Developer",
  "company": "TCS"
}
```

---

### ✅ 8. **Create Relationship: Person WORKS\_AS Job**

* **POST /person/{personId}/job/{jobId}**

---

### ✅ 9. **Recommendation/Search APIs (based on graph)**

* Recommend people with a skill

  * `GET /persons/skill/{skillName}`
* Recommend jobs for person based on skill
* Recommend connections (via `KNOWS` relationship)

---

### ✅ 10. **Delete APIs**

* Delete a person, skill, company, job, or a relationship.

---

Would you like me to generate one of these APIs for you right now (e.g., `addSkill` or `personHasSkill`)?
