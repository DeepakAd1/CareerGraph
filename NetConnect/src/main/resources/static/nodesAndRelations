## Optimized Graph Schema for NetConnect

Based on our discussion about refining the knowledge graph for your Personalized Professional Networking Platform (NetConnect), here's the detailed schema with nodes, their properties, relationships, and relationship properties. This design optimizes for recommendations, search, and scalability in Neo4j, building on your initial ideas. Nodes use unique labels, and relationships are directed where possible for efficient queries. Properties are suggested as strings, numbers, dates, or lists unless specified.

### Nodes and Properties
- **Person** (Represents users/professionals):
  - id: string (unique identifier, e.g., UUID)
  - name: string
  - dateOfBirth: date (date of birth)
  - location: string (e.g., "New York, USA")
  - current_position: string (e.g., "Software Engineer")
  - years_of_experience: number (e.g., 5)
  - education: list of strings (e.g., ["B.S. Computer Science", "M.S. Data Science"])
  - interests: list of strings (e.g., ["AI", "Web Development"])

- **Skill** (Represents professional skills):
  - id: string (unique identifier)
  - name: string (e.g., "Java")
  - certification: string or boolean (e.g., "Oracle Certified Java Programmer" or true/false)
  - proficiency_level: string (e.g., "beginner", "intermediate", "advanced")
  - years_of_experience: number (e.g., 3)

- **Company** (Represents organizations):
  - id: string (unique identifier)
  - name: string (e.g., "Google")
  - location: string (e.g., "Mountain View, CA")
  - employee_count: number (e.g., 150000)
  - industry_type: string (e.g., "Technology" or "Finance")
  - description: string (brief company overview)

- **Job** (Represents job postings):
  - id: string (unique identifier)
  - title: string (e.g., "Senior Developer")
  - description: string (job details)
  - required_qualifications: list of strings (e.g., ["Bachelor's degree", "5+ years experience"])
  - work_type: string (e.g., "remote", "hybrid", "onsite")
  - salary_range: string (e.g., "$120k - $150k")
  - posted_date: date (e.g., 2025-07-28)

### Relationships and Properties
These are directed for query efficiency but can be traversed bidirectionally in Cypher. Properties add context like weights or dates.

- **Person -[:KNOWS]- Person** (For professional connections):
  - strength: string (e.g., "strong", "weak" based on shared attributes)
  - since: date (when the connection was established)

- **Person -[:HAS_SKILL]- Skill** (Links users to their skills):
  - proficiency: number (e.g., 1-10 scale for expertise level)

- **Person -[:WORKS_AT]- Company** (Employment history):
  - start_date: date
  - end_date: date (null if current)
  - role: string (e.g., "Engineer")

- **Company -[:POSTS]- Job** (Jobs posted by companies):
  - posted_date: date (redundant with job property for quick filtering)

- **Skill -[:REQUIRED_FOR]- Job** (Skills needed for jobs; bidirectional for matching):
  - match_score: number (e.g., 0-100 relevance score, calculated or manual)

### Additional Notes
- **Optional Node**: If locations are complex, add a **Location** node (id, city, country) with **Job -[:LOCATED_IN]- Location** (no properties needed).
- **Optional Relationship**: **Person -[:INTERESTED_IN]- Skill/Job** (for user preferences; properties: interest_level: number).
- **Implementation Tip**: In Spring Data Neo4j, define these with annotations (e.g., @Node, @Relationship). For example, a Cypher query for job recommendations could be: `MATCH (p:Person)-[:HAS_SKILL {proficiency: >7}]->(s:Skill)-[:REQUIRED_FOR {match_score: >80}]->(j:Job) RETURN j.title, s.name`.
